 Problem :
 Iced tea Coffee Problem
Two Peoples meet regularly at a cozy coffee shop to catch up on their lives. However, they tend
to interrupt each other while speaking, leading to confusion and frustration. Both of them (Person
1 and Person 2) enjoy iced coffee, but Person 2 frequently misspells it as &quot;iced tea,&quot; leading to
mix-ups and misunderstandings.
Design a C program that utilizes semaphores, threads, and processes to allow the two friends to
communicate effectively and minimize the chances of confusion and mix-ups.
Requirements:
1. The program should simulate a conversation between the two friends, with each speaking
in turn.
2. Use semaphores to ensure that only one person speaks at a time, and the other listens.
Implement a turn-taking mechanism to ensure that each person has an equal opportunity
to speak.
3. Implement error detection and correction for Person 2&#39;s tendency to misspell &quot;iced
coffee&quot; as &quot;iced tea.&quot; Whenever Person 2 mentions &quot;iced tea,&quot; the program should
automatically correct it to &quot;iced coffee.&quot;
4. Use threads or processes to simulate the conversation and error detection/correction
mechanisms.
5. The program should output the corrected conversation, including the number of errors
detected and corrected.
Your program should demonstrate efficient and accurate communication between the two
friends, minimizing confusion and errors, using semaphores, threads, and processes, while they
discuss their mutual love for iced coffee.
After solving the problem, enjoy a cold iced coffee and chat about your life&#39;s enthusiasm with
someone.
